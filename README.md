Welcome to my README file! 

This repository is a collection of projects that showcase my skills and experience in coding and design. These projects were completed as part of Correlation One's software and web development program, where I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience. 

Each project serves as an example of my abilities in various programming languages, frameworks, and design principles. They also demonstrate my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and creativity. 

I have thoroughly enjoyed working on these projects and I am excited to share them with you. My goal is to continually improve and expand upon these projects as I continue to grow as a developer. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my work. I hope it provides insight into my capabilities and potential contributions to any future projects or collaborations. Happy coding!
